            <p>I like to make new friends and help them. So, I helped many student who wanted to be a programmer when I was in college. I taught them how to make program what they want with Ruby on Rails. Also, it's my happiness to make materials related Cloud computing system for the DGB workers. I have been working at DGB Data system for about 3 years. Currently, I work in Cloud Business management team. I am in charge of reading this DGB group to adopt Cloud for the future. So, I did several meeting with few companiess for getting consulting  and we talked about Cloud arcitenct model and technology which can fit DGB group.
